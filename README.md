Recently, a vast amount of Chinese Companies announced their working policy: **996**

996 means the daily working hour starts from 9 am, ends at 9 pm, and employee works 6 days a week. However, **996** is just a general name for those companies who require employee work on regulary overtime. Some of them even reqest people work on **007**.


[Why we call 996.VET]
---
**996** companies treat the employee like animals. They need a cure!
The main propose of this project includes **2** parts:
-We are calling a campaign to fight against those improper treatment to those employee. License could be refused to those companies who do not respect to applicable laws and regulations. **refer to 996 license(https://github.com/996icu/996.ICU/blob/master/LICENSE)**
-Due to the reason those 996 companies use terms like "volunteer", "dedicate" in order to avoid the legal issue, we are here to collect any evidence of them and help to report it to **Labor and Social Security Bureau**. You can submit your report and evidence here **（https://996.vet)**
**Be aware, this website is using anonymous mode to protect the people who submit the reports. **
